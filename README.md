not a bad state

## status
WIP

## motivation
State machines can sometimes be a hassle to build.
  
Vars / Events provide an obvious api, but it's nonobvious how to test that they
are OK etc.
  
pennsylvania provides a library for building state machines, and also verification
that you can't end up in a bad state.
